#### Preparation

```
git clone https://github.com/Dynatrace/Dynatrace-Test-Automation-Samples
C:\YOURDIR> Set JAVA_HOME=YOUR JAVA HOME
C:\YOURDIR> Set PATH=%PATH%;ANTHOME\bin
```

#### Run

* Start easyTravel (only web required, Standard scenario, manual visits)
* Make sure the agents are connected to your Dynatrace AppMon server

*Option 1*: Execute with automatic test number (no test run registration to AppMon Server)
```
C:\YOURDIR\saucelabs> ant test
```

*Option 2*: Execute with Register Test Run REST CALL (to pass AppMon Server meta data such as build & version information)
```
C:\YOURDIR\saucelabs> ant register-test
```

#### Result


*Option 1*: Run the sample with Ant without test registration (auto-registred test run generated by Dynatrace AppMon Server)



*Option 2*: Run the sample with Ant with test registration (to pass Dynatrace AppMon Server meta data such as build & version information)
